## Problem Specification

“Aviation is a major industry, and Air Traffic Control (ATC) provides a critical service in assuring safety and promising efficiency of air travel.” The purpose of this report outlines an effective software intensive system for use by air traffic controllers and balances the need for safety and efficiency within its requirements. The software will consist of two major systems: an ATC System, as used by air traffic controllers; and a Flight Plan Logging System, as used by Pilots, both of which are outlined during this document. This document does not specify any testing of the software.
